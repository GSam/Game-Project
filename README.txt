Setting:
You have been kicked out of the Outpost, the last remaining human refuge, for heinous crimes. 
The Outpost elder used to speak of three or four mythical artifacts that would grant passage to any outsider
into the Outpost. It is your job to find these artifacts and return to the great gate to get back to your
family. As you walk the world you will find other settlements that will provide shelter and supplies for
staying alive in the zombie infested world. The zombies frenzy at night, so your best defense is to either 
stay inside and shut the doors or brave the wilderness with a torch as a tool for calming them.

in the main screen.

Chests are opened with a right click, and closed by walking away.

equip panel by pressing the 'u' key. Note that items need to placed in the correct slot, and

Chat system commands (works only with the client/server, not single player): 
/name [name] - set name

There are two types of saving occurring within the game. Single player saves and server saving. 
Saving on single player is just hitting 4 and loading is hitting 5. 

With server saving, the client sends a message using the 4 key for the server to save the current 
game along with the player data (names) files to store who was who. Server also automatically saves 
the game every 5 minutes. Do note that you should not mix the save files as this has unexpected consequences.
