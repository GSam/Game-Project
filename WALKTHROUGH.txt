WALKTHROUGH:

The goal of the game is to get the treasures required to be let back into the Outpost. These
are hidden around the world for you to find, and require unlocking doors and chests and finding
keys, while avoiding zombies.

There are two treasures in the world, the first in the church near where you start, and the second
in the town on the grassy area a few minutes walk away. Each has its own small puzzle to solve. For
marking purposes however, we've only required you get one of the treasures to win. Here is a short
walkthrough for how to get the treasure in the church. Note that you must be very close to chests to
open them.

You must find three keys:

1. In the large house adjacent to the church (not the gas station), there is a locked chest with
   the first key in it. The key to open the locked chest is in the room too. This key unlocks the
   outer set of church doors.
2. In the left side entrance of the church, inside the first set of doors, you can find the second
   key. This opens the inner church doors.
3. In the house opposite the church is a chest with the third key in it, this unlocks the chest
   inside the church, near the altar.

Once you have the treasure from inside the chest in the church, walk to the large Outpost gate in
the distance and activate it with the treasure in your inventory to win the game.
